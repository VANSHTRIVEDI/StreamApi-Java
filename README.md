🌐 What is Stream API in Java?
Stream API, introduced in Java 8, revolutionizes data processing by providing a modern, functional approach. Streams allow for efficient and readable data manipulations. They support various operations to filter, map, and collect data seamlessly. Unlike traditional loops, Streams enable developers to write more expressive and maintainable code by chaining operations in a declarative manner. This not only enhances code readability but also leverages parallel processing, improving performance for large datasets.
